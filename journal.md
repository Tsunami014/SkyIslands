(This is commited the day after, sorry I forgot to yesterday)
- Worked on my game. Drew lots of nice tiles and made a test map! Have no code yet tho.
- I've finished probably about half the tiles, and not including the decor. I'll finish the tiles later and work on the decor now so I can start coding soon.
- My time tracking tool says I have spent 4 hours 53 min and 28 sec so far making assets (this doesn't include making the level, which I have no tracking method for). I hope this counts...

- Made the ldtk map auto export for usage later
